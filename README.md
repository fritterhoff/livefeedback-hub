# Live Feedback Extension for JupyterHub

This package provides a service extension for JupyterHub to collect notebooks from JupyterLabs, check them using predefined Otter-Grader Checks and saves the results in a database. The results can be used for real time feedback during study courses and to evaluate the knowledge anonymously.
